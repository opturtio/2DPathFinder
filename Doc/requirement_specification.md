## Introduction
This project is for the Algorithms and AI Lab, part of the Bachelor of Computer Science program.
The project's goal is to implement Dijkstra's algorithm in C# and compare its performance and characteristics against the Jump Point Search (JPS) algorithm in the context of pathfinding on a 2D grid map representation of the chosen map. 

In this project, I am implementing and comparing two algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm and the Jump Point Search (JPS) algorithm. These are being utilized to efficiently solve the problem of finding the shortest path on a 2D grid map, which can represent, for example, urban road networks.

The program uses a 2D grid map as input. It'll need a starting point and an ending point for finding paths. There might be different costs for moving through certain areas on the map. These inputs help test how well each algorithm finds paths. I aim to figure out how fast these algorithms use.
