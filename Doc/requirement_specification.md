## Introduction
As part of the Bachelor of Computer Science program at the Algorithms and AI Lab, this project focuses on the implementation and comparative analysis of pathfinding algorithms in a 2D grid map environment. The project involves creating Dijkstra's algorithm, the A* algorithm, and the Jump Point Search (JPS) algorithm using C#.

The core objective is to explore these algorithms' efficiency and performance characteristics in determining the shortest path on a grid-based map, which could be comparable to urban road networks. The application will require a defined starting and ending point on the grid to conduct pathfinding tasks. Through this implementation, the project aims to evaluate the speed and effectiveness of each algorithm, providing a comparative study of their results in practical scenarios.
