# Testing documentation

### Unit testing
Unit testing was made by using NUint and NUnit 3 Test Adapter
Unit testing coverage can be found [here](./../PathFinder.Tests/CoverageReport/index.html). I wil change this to photo later.

### Creating coverage report
Run [generate-coverage-report.bat](./../PathFinder.Tests/generate-coverage-report.bat) to create coverage report.
