-----------|------|--------|
2023-10-30 | 1h	  | Studied the project |
2023-11-03 | 2h   | Created the project/basic files and added it to Labtool |
2023-11-04 | 6h   | Decided the project language and created requirement specification |
2023-11-08 | 6h	  | Created program logic and file structure |
2023-11-09 | 8h   | Reorganized and renamed my project to PathFinder, added new functionalities for map handling, and enhanced my understanding of lists and tuples in C#. |
2023-11-11 | 4h   | Refactored and commented the classes. Created possibility to load the map from the resources as a string |
2023-11-16 | 8h	  | Set up testing environment. Created generate-coverage-report.bat file to create coverage report |
2023-11-17 | 7h | Continued to figure out the problems with testing and created Node class |
2023-11-19 | 9h | Created GraphBuilder and Graph algorithms. Added stylecheck and fixed dozens of stylecheck warnings |
2023-11-25 | 6h | Created bases for Heap, Dijkstra and AlgorithmComparisonManager classes. Fixed extra node bug. |
2023-11-26 | 4h | Created Dijkstra algorithm. |
2023-11-28 | 3h | Studied JPS algorithm |
2023-12-05 | 2h | Studied JPS algorithm |
2023-12-06 | 3h | Studied JPS algorithm and tried to figure out how to implement it |
2023-12-09 | 4h | Updating documentation |
2023-12-10 | 6h | Created visualization to see how the algorithms work |
2023-12-11 | 6h | Modified PathVisualizer class. Created ShortestPathBuilder class. Created possibility to start debugging. |
2023-12-12 | 2h | Created possibility to print the current map to console in main menu and modified PathVisualizer to be more efficient and reduce flickering. |
2023-12-13 | 9h | Created PathCoordinatesValidator and made small modifications |
2023-12-16 | 6h | Created A* algorithm |
2023-12-17 | 8h | Fixed path visualizer and the way paths are presented in console. Fixed A* algorithm and a major bug where graph nodes costs were not initialized. |
2023-12-18 | 4h | Created result screen for algorithm comparison and fixed the graph so that jumping over corners is not possible. |
2024-01-17 | 4h | Trying to fix JPS |
2024-01-18 | 5h | Continued fixing JPS |
2024-01-19 | 3h | JPS IS WORKING!!! |
SUM | 126h | |
