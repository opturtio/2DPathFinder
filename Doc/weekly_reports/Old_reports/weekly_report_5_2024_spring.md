# Weekly Report 5


### 15.2.2024
Today I made peer review. It took some time. I've been sick whole week so I havent felt like doing anything.

### 16.2.2024
I made few hours test to count the lengths of the shortest paths but didn't push them. I have problem with ShortestPathBuilder.ShortestPathLength() method. The class is static and it causes problems. I will continue next week. I still feel sick.
