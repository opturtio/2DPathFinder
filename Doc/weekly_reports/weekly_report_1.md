# Weekly report 1

### Monday 30.10.2023
I started to check what the course is about. I read everything from the Moodle page.

### Friday 3.11.2023
I read partly again the Moodle page, created the project, and added it to Labtool.

### Saturday 4.11.2023 
I struggled for a while with whether to do my project in C# or Python. In the end, I settled on C#. I want to enhance my C# skills. I've been working with it for a year now and I'm aiming to get better. I'm aware that choosing C# might make the project harder, but I believe it will be more educational. Now I have written a basic requirement specification. I will update it next week. I had important exam this week so I just had Saturday to set up the project. In addition, I updated the README.md and created timesheet.
