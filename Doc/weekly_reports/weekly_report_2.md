# Weekly report 2

### Wednesday 17.7.2024
I tried to solve the problem with big open maps. I still cannot figure out what the problem is. I was testing the heuristic method, and it should work correctly. I still need to check it out again. The problem might be the heap or jump method's recursion. While watching the visualization, I can see that the algorithm sometimes checks jump points far away and continues from them when they are not really important. I need to figure out if this is normal or if it is a bug.

Continued to debug. I think I need to create more tests and then continue. One problem could be that the algorigm works correct but the path construction does not work correctly. Need to check it next week. I haven't pushed anything this week because I am just checking what the problem is. I cannot continue more this week because I have a birthday soon and I am going to travel. Next week, I can check a little bit more, but in August, I will have a lot of time to solve this problem.
