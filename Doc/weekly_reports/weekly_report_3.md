# Weekly Report 3

Last evening in bed, half asleep, I realized that I did not reset the visited notes, so that's why Dijkstra did not work. Now I have fixed it, and it is working. I realized that JPS does not always work. Sometimes, it just jumps to the end. It has something to do with the Jump method's recursion. Now, maps will be saved to the 'PathFinder.Tests/Results' directory if the specified conditions are met. Conditions can be changed. This is essential for debugging. I created path found value for each algorithm, and because of this, I know for sure that JPS does not work on every occasion.

Made small changes and tried to solve the problem with JPS. It is working most of the time but it need to be adjusted. I think I need to start to read about it again.
