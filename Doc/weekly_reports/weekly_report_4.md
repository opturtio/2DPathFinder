I created two new brances because I started to create pruning for JPS. This have been so difficult task. This project feels never ending and I cannot find solution. There is not really good material for JPS where I could see the whole algorithm. I can just find pieces and all the implementation differ. Today I used six hours to find the solution. I implemented some sort of pruning. I also deleted many hours of work. Later I realized I should have just created new branch out of it. It had some valuable code. Well I still try to finish the algorithm before end of this course.
