# Weekly Report 6


### 24.2.2024
I made the second code review. I was sick so I did not have time to do this project. I still have time to finish. From monday I will put all effort to finish this project. 
I will start with testing. I want to create more test scenarios and shortestpath length tests. Then I try systematically figure out what is the problem.
