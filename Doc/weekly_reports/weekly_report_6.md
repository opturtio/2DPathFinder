# Weekly report 6

### Friday 16.8.2024

Still continuing to solve the problem with the Berlin and London map. I fixed pruning and jump method but no effect. I am pretty sure that the algorithm works in both maps. I saw this by watching the debuggers visualization. The algorithm works in smaller maps and in mazes. The problem is that it visits same nodes twice so when shortest path is builded it enters to infinite loop and the program freezes. I dont have anymore ideas how to fix this.

I continued to find the solution. I went through heap, pruning and jump method again. Try to think solution to revisiting nodes but cannot find one. I do not see point to continue if I dont get solution to this problem. I will finish the program and make the comparison tests with two different mazes because the algorithm works in mazes. I will finish all the documentation that is needed. I hope this is okey so I can pass the course? This is third time I am making it and I want to start my Masters next month. This course is giving me too much stress and I have spent too much time to it over 200h. I will still try to finish the algorithm in other branch but next week my main goal is to finish the project and documentation so I can present it.
